I'm an **LLM / ML Engineer** passionate about deploying AI systems that deliver real-world impact. My expertise spans **Speech Recognition (ASR)**, **Vision-Language Models (VLM)**, and **Large Language Models (LLM)** — with a strong focus on production-grade implementations.

I specialize in building **RAG and Agent-based automation systems** that solve actual business problems. My experience includes working in both **military and enterprise environments**, where security constraints, limited resources, and operational stability are non-negotiable.
